The following tasks were implemented in the project: Tic-tac-toe game 
# Rules
Tic Tac Toe is a logic game between two opponents on a square field of 3 by 3 cells or larger. One of the players plays with "crosses", the second - with "noes". Players take turns putting 3x3 signs on the free cells of the field. One is always crosses, the other is always zeros.
# Tech stack 
* javascript
* html/css
# Work with sounds
1)added sound effects when we draw a cross or a zero, we will hear a realistic sound as if we are drawing it all in a notebook live.
2)also added animation when you click on the field, then you will gradually draw a circle or a cross, each of them has its own setTimeout.

# Main idea

3.and most importantly, this game does not need internet.
